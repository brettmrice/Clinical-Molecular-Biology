# Oligonucleotides {-}

**PCR Oligonucleotide Design and Preparation** is the art and science of getting your primers right. Think of primers as the highly specific **GPS coordinates** for your PCR reaction – they tell the polymerase exactly where to start copying on the DNA template. If your coordinates are wrong or fuzzy, you'll either amplify the wrong thing or nothing at all!

Therefore, rigorous primer design using appropriate software and databases, choosing the right purification level, and careful handling/storage practices are absolutely essential for reliable and accurate molecular diagnostic testing

## **PCR Primer Design: Crafting the Perfect 'GPS Coordinates'** {-}

The goal of primer design is to create short, single-stranded DNA sequences (oligonucleotides, typically 18-30 bases long) that will specifically and efficiently bind (anneal) only to the intended target sequences flanking the region you want to amplify

## **Key Principles & Considerations** {-}

### **Specificity (The MOST Important Factor)** {-}

*   **Goal:** Primers must bind *only* to the target site(s) and nowhere else in the background genome (e.g., human genome, bacterial genome)
*   **How**
    *   **Sequence Selection:** Choose unique regions within the target DNA. Avoid repetitive sequences
    *   **Database Checking (BLAST):** Use tools like NCBI BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) against the relevant genome database (e.g., human, viral, bacterial) to check if your proposed primer sequences have significant similarity to unintended sites. This is CRUCIAL to prevent amplification of non-target sequences (which could lead to false positives or confusing results)
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Non-specific binding leads to artifact bands on a gel, incorrect results in qPCR, and potentially disastrous misdiagnoses

### **Primer Length** {-}

*   **Typical Range:** 18-25 base pairs (bp) is common
*   **Too Short (<18 bp):** May lack specificity (more likely to find matches elsewhere in a large genome) and have a low melting temperature (Tm)
*   **Too Long (>30 bp):** Can have reduced annealing efficiency (slower binding), higher cost, and increased likelihood of forming secondary structures. Specificity gain becomes marginal

### **Melting Temperature (Tm)** {-}

*   **Definition:** The temperature at which 50% of the primer-template duplex has dissociated into single strands. It indicates the stability of the primer binding
*   **Importance**
    *   The Tm dictates the optimal **annealing temperature (Ta)** for the PCR cycle. Ta is typically set ~3-5°C *below* the calculated Tm
    *   **Primer Pair Matching:** The forward and reverse primers in a pair should have very similar Tm values (ideally within 1-2°C, max 5°C difference). If Tms are too different, one primer might bind efficiently while the other binds poorly or non-specifically at a given annealing temperature, leading to inefficient or failed amplification
*   **Calculation**
    *   **Basic Formula (for <20 bp):** Tm ≈ 4°C × (# G/C) + 2°C × (# A/T)
    *   **More Accurate Formulas/Algorithms:** Primer design software uses more sophisticated thermodynamic calculations (Nearest-Neighbor method) considering salt concentration, primer concentration, and base stacking interactions. **Always use the Tm calculated by reliable software.**
*   **Target Tm Range:** Often aimed for 55-65°C, but depends on the polymerase and application

### **GC Content** {-}

*   **Definition:** The percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) bases in the primer sequence
*   **Optimal Range:** Typically 40-60%
*   **Importance:** GC pairs have 3 hydrogen bonds (vs. 2 for AT), contributing significantly to primer stability and Tm. Very low GC content leads to low Tm. Very high GC content (>65%) can lead to overly stable binding and potential non-specific priming issues
*   **Distribution:** Avoid long stretches of Gs or Cs

### **Avoiding Secondary Structures** {-}

*   **Hairpins:** If a primer has complementary sequences within itself, it can fold back and bind to itself, forming a hairpin loop. Strong hairpins (especially at the 3' end) can prevent the primer from binding to the template
*   **Self-Dimers (Homodimers):** A primer molecule can bind to another identical primer molecule
*   **How:** Primer design software checks for potential secondary structures and calculates their stability (ΔG value). Avoid primers predicted to form stable secondary structures, particularly at the annealing temperature

### **Avoiding Primer-Dimers (Cross-Dimers)** {-}

*   **What:** The forward primer binds to the reverse primer
*   **Problem:** If primer-dimers form, they create a very short template that can be amplified very efficiently by the polymerase, competing with the actual target amplification. This consumes primers and dNTPs, reduces target yield, and results in a characteristic low molecular weight band on a gel (often <100 bp). Especially problematic in qPCR as it generates unwanted signal
*   **How to Avoid:** Check for complementarity between the forward and reverse primers, *especially at their 3' ends*. Even 2-3 complementary bases at the 3' ends can lead to significant primer-dimer formation because the polymerase can extend from the 3' end. Software tools are essential for checking this

### **GC Clamp** {-}

*   **What:** Having one or two G or C bases at the very **3' end** of the primer
*   **Why:** The 3' end is where the polymerase starts extension. G/C bases provide stronger binding (3 H-bonds) at this critical end, helping to "clamp" the primer down correctly and promote efficient polymerase binding and extension. Avoid ending with a T. Avoid more than 3 G/Cs at the 3' end (can promote mispriming)

### **Avoiding Runs and Repeats** {-}

*   **Runs:** Long stretches of a single base (e.g., AAAAAAA). Can cause polymerase "slippage" and reduce specificity. Max run usually 4 bases
*   **Repeats:** Di-nucleotide repeats (e.g., ATATATAT). Can lead to mispriming

### **Target Amplicon Length** {-}

*   **Definition:** The size of the DNA fragment produced by the primer pair
*   **Considerations**
    *   **Standard PCR:** Typically 100-500 bp is good for gel visualization and efficiency. Longer fragments (>1 kb) may require optimized conditions (longer extension times, different polymerases)
    *   **qPCR:** Usually shorter amplicons (70-200 bp) are preferred for maximum efficiency and faster run times
    *   **Degraded DNA:** For samples with potentially degraded DNA (e.g., FFPE tissue, forensic samples), design primers to produce very short amplicons (<150 bp) to increase the chance of amplifying intact template

### **Primer Location** {-}

*   Where within the gene/target region should primers bind?
*   **Avoid SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms):** If possible, avoid placing primers (especially the 3' end) over known common SNP locations, as a mismatch could prevent binding and lead to allele dropout (false negative for that allele). Check databases like dbSNP
*   **Spanning Introns (for cDNA):** When amplifying cDNA (from RNA) to detect gene expression, design primers that bind to different exons or span an exon-exon junction. This way, if there's contaminating genomic DNA (gDNA), the product from gDNA (containing the intron) will be much larger or won't amplify, preventing false positives from gDNA contamination

## **Tools for Primer Design** {-}

*   **Software:** Numerous free web-based tools (e.g., Primer3, NCBI Primer-BLAST) and commercial software packages (e.g., Geneious, OligoAnalyzer - IDT) automate many of these checks. They take your target sequence and suggest primer pairs based on the parameters you set. **Using software is standard practice.**
*   **Databases:** NCBI GenBank, Ensembl for sequences; dbSNP for polymorphism information

## **Oligonucleotide Preparation & Handling: From Synthesis to Bench** {-}

Once designed, primers need to be synthesized and prepared correctly for use

1.  **Synthesis**
    *   Performed by specialized commercial vendors using automated **phosphoramidite chemical synthesis**
    *   DNA bases are added one by one to a growing chain attached to a solid support (like controlled pore glass)
    *   Highly optimized and efficient process

2.  **Purification**
    *   Synthesis isn't perfect; it results in the desired full-length oligonucleotide plus some shorter, failed sequences (n-1, n-2 products). Purification removes these contaminants
    *   **Levels of Purification**
        *   **Desalting:** Removes residual salts and very small molecules from synthesis. Suitable for routine PCR where high specificity isn't paramount. Lowest cost
        *   **Cartridge Purification:** A step up, removes more failed sequences. Good for many applications like standard qPCR, cloning
        *   **HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography):** Provides high purity (>90%). Recommended for sensitive applications like multiplex PCR, cloning large fragments, or when primers are very long
        *   **PAGE (Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis):** Highest purity (>95%), separates by size. Used for very demanding applications (therapeutics, crystallography) or very long oligos (>50 bp)
    *   **Choice depends on the application's sensitivity to truncated primers.:** For most clinical diagnostic PCR/qPCR, desalting or cartridge purification is often sufficient, but HPLC might be chosen for assays requiring maximum accuracy (e.g., multiplex assays)

3.  **Quality Control (QC) by Vendor**
    *   Vendors typically perform QC checks:
        *   **OD260:** Measures absorbance at 260 nm to quantify the amount of oligonucleotide synthesized (reported in OD units, nanomoles, or micrograms)
        *   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** Verifies that the major product has the correct molecular weight corresponding to the desired sequence. Confirms identity

4.  **Delivery & Storage**
    *   Primers usually arrive as a **lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder** – a small pellet at the bottom of the tube. This is the most stable form for long-term storage
    *   **Storage (Lyophilized):** Store at -20°C (or -80°C for very long term). Protect from light. Stable for months to years
    *   **Reconstitution**
        *   Briefly centrifuge the tube *before opening* to ensure the pellet is at the bottom
        *   Resuspend the powder in a nuclease-free buffer (e.g., TE buffer pH 8.0 - Tris-EDTA) or nuclease-free water to create a concentrated **stock solution** (e.g., 100 µM). TE buffer is often preferred as EDTA chelates divalent cations like Mg++, inhibiting potential DNase activity. Water is fine but less protective
        *   Ensure the pellet is completely dissolved (vortex gently, let sit, quick spin)
    *   **Storage (Stock Solution):** Store at -20°C. Stable for months. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles
    *   **Working Solutions:** Prepare dilutions from the stock solution (e.g., 10 µM) in nuclease-free buffer/water. Store at -20°C (short-term at 4°C might be okay for a few days/weeks, but check stability)
    *   **Aliquoting:** It's highly recommended to aliquot the stock solution into smaller volumes upon initial reconstitution. This prevents contaminating the entire stock and minimizes freeze-thaw cycles for the bulk of the primer

5.  **Handling**
    *   Always use **nuclease-free tips, tubes, and buffer/water** to avoid degradation
    *   Wear gloves
    *   Keep primer solutions on ice when working with them

## **Clinical Significance** {-}

In a clinical lab, poorly designed or prepared primers can lead to:

*   **False Negatives:** Failure to amplify the target sequence even when it's present (e.g., due to poor Tm, secondary structures, SNPs under primer)
*   **False Positives:** Amplification of unintended sequences (due to lack of specificity, contamination)
*   **Low Sensitivity:** Inefficient amplification reduces the ability to detect low levels of target
*   **Inaccurate Quantification (qPCR):** Primer-dimers or poor efficiency skews quantitative results
