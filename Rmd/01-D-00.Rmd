# Genetics {-}

Human genetics in the clinical lab often deals with variations within a relatively stable (per generation) but complex genome to understand inherited risk and disease. Microbial genetics contends with highly dynamic and diverse genomes, focusing on identification and the rapid evolution of clinically critical traits like drug resistance, primarily driven by HGT

##  **Human Genetics vs. Microbial Genetics** {-}

Both fields explore how genetic information encoded in nucleic acids dictates function, variation, and disease. However, their context and the types of questions asked in the clinical lab are distinct

**Human Genetics (Focus: The Host Blueprint)**

*   **Genome Structure:** Large (~3 billion bp), diploid (2n=46), **linear chromosomes** complexed with **histones** into chromatin, located within a **nucleus**. Contains vast amounts of non-coding DNA, including introns
*   **Gene Regulation:** Complex, involving transcription factors, enhancers/silencers, chromatin remodeling, extensive RNA processing (**splicing** of introns/exons), and **epigenetics** (methylation, histone modification)
*   **Variation & Inheritance**
    *   Mutations (point, CNVs, rearrangements) arise but at a slower rate relative to organism lifespan
    *   Inheritance is primarily **vertical:** (parent to offspring) via sexual reproduction, following **Mendelian** (AD, AR, XL) and **Non-Mendelian** (Mitochondrial, Imprinting, Triplet Repeats) patterns
    *   Focus on **germline:** mutations (inherited diseases) and **somatic** mutations (cancer)
*   **Clinical Focus**
    *   Diagnosing **inherited monogenic disorders:** (e.g., CF, Sickle Cell)
    *   Identifying **chromosomal abnormalities:** (e.g., Down syndrome)
    *   **Cancer genetics:** Detecting inherited predispositions (e.g., BRCA) and somatic mutations guiding targeted therapy (e.g., EGFR, KRAS)
    *   **Pharmacogenomics:** Predicting drug response based on genetic variants
    *   Carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis

##  **Microbial Genetics (Focus: Pathogen/Commensal Blueprints)** {-}

*   **Genome Structure:** Highly diverse!
    *   **Bacteria:** Typically smaller (~1-10 million bp), haploid, **single circular chromosome** in a **nucleoid** (no nucleus). Often contain crucial **plasmids**. Genes densely packed, often in **operons**; introns are rare
    *   **Viruses:** Tiny genomes; can be DNA/RNA, ss/ds, linear/circular/segmented. Rely heavily on host machinery
    *   **Fungi/Parasites:** Eukaryotic, with nuclear chromosomes, but generally smaller genomes than humans
*   **Gene Regulation:** Primarily geared towards rapid adaptation. **Operons** allow coordinated response. Transcription/translation often **coupled** (bacteria)
*   **Variation & Inheritance**
    *   High mutation rates due to rapid replication cycles
    *   Massive role of **Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)**: sharing genes *between* organisms via **transformation, transduction, conjugation**
    *   **Mobile Genetic Elements (MGEs):** like plasmids, transposons, and integrons are key drivers of variation and spread of traits like resistance
*   **Clinical Focus**
    *   **Pathogen Identification:** Detecting specific microbial DNA/RNA for diagnosis
    *   **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** Detecting specific genes (*mecA*, *blaKPC*, *vanA*) or mutations conferring resistance to guide treatment **(MAJOR FOCUS)**
    *   **Virulence Factor Detection:** Identifying genes associated with pathogenicity
    *   **Epidemiology/Strain Typing:** Tracking outbreaks and transmission using genetic markers or sequencing
    *   Viral load monitoring and genotyping
