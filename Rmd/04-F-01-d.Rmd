# Purchasing & Inventory {-}

In the molecular laboratory, effective purchasing and inventory management are not merely administrative tasks; they are critical components of Quality Assurance (QA). Molecular reagents - such as thermostable polymerases, fluorescent probes, and RNA extraction kits - are among the most expensive and least stable consumables in clinical medicine. Poor management leads to "stockouts" (inability to test patients), financial loss through expiration (waste), or technical failure due to reagent degradation. Therefore, the financial management of inventory requires a strategy that balances cost-efficiency with the strict preservation of biological activity

## The Purchasing Process (Procurement) {-}

Purchasing is the systematic acquisition of supplies. It involves selecting vendors, negotiating contracts, and generating the legal documentation required to buy goods. In a molecular lab, this process is often driven by the need for "Lot Consistency" to minimize the frequency of QC validation

*   **Requisitions vs. Purchase Orders (PO)**
    *   **Requisition:** An internal request generated by the laboratory scientist or supervisor asking the hospital's finance department to buy something. It is not a legal contract
    *   **Purchase Order (PO):** The external legal contract sent to the vendor. It specifies the item, price, quantity, and shipping terms. The PO number is used to track the shipment and pay the invoice
*   **Standing Orders**
    *   For high-volume tests (e.g., standard infectious disease panels), the laboratory establishes a "Standing Order." The vendor automatically ships a set quantity of reagents at regular intervals (e.g., every Monday)
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces administrative paperwork and prevents stockouts caused by forgetting to order
    *   **Risk:** If testing volume drops (e.g., end of flu season), reagents pile up and may expire before use
*   **Lot Sequestration (Lot Hold)**
    *   **The Concept:** Molecular assays are sensitive to slight manufacturing variations in enzyme efficiency or primer concentration. Changing reagent lots often requires a time-consuming "Crossover Study" to verify performance
    *   **The Strategy:** The laboratory asks the manufacturer to "sequester" (set aside) a 6-month or 1-year supply of a *single specific lot number* in their warehouse. The lab draws from this single lot over time
    *   **Financial Impact:** This saves money by reducing the number of QC runs, calibrations, and validation studies required for new lots

## Inventory Management Strategies {-}

Once items are purchased, they enter the laboratory inventory. The goal is to maintain the lowest possible inventory level (to free up cash and storage space) without risking a shortage. This is managed through "Par Levels" and rotation protocols

*   **Par Level Management**
    *   **Par Level (Periodic Automatic Replacement):** The minimum quantity of an item that must be on hand to ensure operations continue until the next delivery arrives. When stock hits the "Min" (minimum), an order is placed to reach the "Max" (maximum)
    *   **Calculation:** Par levels are calculated based on the "Burn Rate" (average daily usage) and the "Lead Time" (how long it takes for the vendor to deliver). *Example:* If you use 1 kit per day and shipping takes 3 days, your absolute minimum is 3 kits. A safe Par Min might be 5 kits
*   **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
    *   **Principle:** New stock is placed *behind* old stock on the shelf or in the freezer. The oldest stock (with the nearest expiration date) is always used first
    *   **Molecular Criticality:** Enzymes lose activity over time, even within their expiration window. Using FIFO prevents the accumulation of expired, wasted reagents
*   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Inventory**
    *   A "Lean" management strategy where the lab keeps almost zero surplus stock, relying on next-day delivery from vendors
    *   **Risk:** While this saves storage space and reduces expiration waste, it leaves the lab highly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions (e.g., backorders or shipping delays due to weather), which can shut down patient testing

## Receiving & Quality Assurance {-}

The inventory process begins the moment a package arrives at the loading dock. For molecular reagents, the "Receiving" step is a critical control point for specimen integrity due to the "Cold Chain" requirements

*   **The Cold Chain**
    *   Molecular reagents have diverse storage requirements: Room Temp (buffers), Refrigerated (primers/probes), Frozen -20°C (enzymes/master mix), and Ultra-Low -70°C (RNA standards)
    *   **Inspection:** Staff must inspect packages immediately upon arrival. If a box containing dry ice arrives empty (thawed), or if a frozen enzyme pack is warm to the touch, the shipment must be rejected. The degradation of *Taq* polymerase due to warm shipping will not be visible until the assay fails weeks later
*   **Labeling and Logging**
    *   **Date Received / Date Opened:** CLIA requires that all reagents be labeled with the date they were received and the date they were opened. This establishes the expiration clock
    *   **Lot Tracking:** The lot numbers of incoming reagents should be logged into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) or an inventory log. This facilitates rapid recalls if a manufacturer identifies a defect

## Storage & Handling (Preventing Waste) {-}

Financial loss in molecular biology is often caused by improper handling of reagents after they are received. Protecting the "Capital" invested in reagents requires strict storage protocols

*   **Aliquoting (The "Freeze-Thaw" Rule)**
    *   **The Problem:** Repeated freezing and thawing of reagents causes ice crystal formation that shears DNA probes and denatures enzymes. It also introduces contamination risks
    *   **The Solution:** Upon receipt, bulk reagents should be aliquotted into single-use or small-volume tubes. The master stock is frozen and only touched once. This protects the bulk investment; if one aliquot is contaminated, only a few dollars are lost rather than the entire kit
*   **Light Sensitivity**
    *   Fluorescent probes (TaqMan, FRET) are photosensitive. Exposure to ambient lab light causes "photobleaching" (loss of signal intensity). These must be stored in amber tubes or opaque boxes. Failure to do so leads to "False Negative" QC results and wasted runs

## Inventory Audits & Valuation {-}

To ensure financial accuracy, the physical inventory must be reconciled with the financial records

*   **Cycle Counts**
    *   A periodic manual count of physical items on the shelf compared to what the computer system says should be there. Discrepancies indicate theft, failure to log usage, or waste
*   **Waste Tracking**
    *   When reagents are discarded before they are used (due to expiration, contamination, or instrument error), they must be logged as "Waste."
    *   **Financial Importance:** Tracking waste allows the manager to adjust Par Levels. If the lab consistently throws away 50% of a specific primer set because it expires, the order volume must be reduced to save money
