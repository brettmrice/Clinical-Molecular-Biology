Stringency refers combination conditions (temperature, salt concentration) used washes dictate perfectly matched probe target sequences must remain hybridized (bound together)\nHigh Stringency: Conditions promote dissociation weakly bound probes (e.g., high temperature, low salt concentration). perfectly (nearly perfectly) matched probe-target hybrids remain bound. Used detect highly specific targets\nLow Stringency: Conditions allow even partially mismatched probe-target hybrids remain bound (e.g., lower temperature, higher salt concentration). Used looking related sequences (e.g., homologous genes different species) probe isn’t perfect match\n\nWashing Done: Typically involves series washes, starting lower stringency (higher salt, lower temp) progressing higher stringency (lower salt, higher temp)\nSalt Concentration (e.g., SSC buffer - Saline Sodium Citrate): Salt ions (Na+) shield negative charges phosphate backbones probe target. High salt concentration stabilizes duplex (lower stringency). Low salt concentration increases charge repulsion, destabilizing mismatched duplexes (higher stringency)\nTemperature: Higher temperatures provide kinetic energy, making easier hydrogen bonds break. Thus, higher temperatures increase stringency, melting less stable (mismatched) hybrids\nDenaturants (e.g., Formamide): Sometimes included hybridization/wash buffers. Formamide lowers melting temperature nucleic acid duplexes, effectively increasing stringency given temperature\n\nFinding Balance: adjust wash conditions (time, temp, salt concentration) get strongest signal specific target lowest background noise\nPurpose: wash away unbound probe probe bound non-specifically weakly (e.g., sequences partial similarity), leaving probe specifically bound target sequence. step determines signal--noise ratio experimentThe Concept Stringency: key!
